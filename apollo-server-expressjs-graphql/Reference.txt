=======
  Types 

  1. Offset Pagination

      ---
        after first set of result is loaded if new item is added in db, 
        offset will show previous displayed result also 


  2. Cursor Pagination (Recommended)
      Cursor pagination is a common technique to paginate data in GraphQL APIs.
      It involves using a "cursor" value to indicate the position in the dataset, 
      which the client can pass to the server to fetch the next page of results.


1. Simplex 
    example: Radio
    sender => receiver 

2. Half Duplex 
    example: Walkie Talkie, Http 
    sender ==> receiver 
    sender <== receiver 

    sender ==> receiver 
    sender <== receiver 

3. Full Duplex 
    examples: Telephone, WebSocket
    sender <=> receiver
